		The qualification in fencing for the Olympic Games 2024 in Paris is not easily explained.
		To begin with, the qualification is split into teams and individuals.
	</p>
	
	<p class="index_paragraph">
		The system is explained most easily by starting with the teams.
		<span class="qualified_1">The top 4 teams are directly qualified.</span>
		<span class="qualified_2">Then, the top team from each of the four zones (Europe, Asia/Oceania, Americas, Africa) is qualified, as long as it is placed 16th or better.</span>
		<span class="qualified_3">If one or more of the zones do not have a team in 5th to 16th place, the best so-far not-qualified team(s) in the rankings are qualified.</span>
		This results in a total of eight teams with each team nominating four fencers, three of which also start in the individual competition.
	</p>
	
	<p class="index_paragraph">
		<span class="qualified_1">For the individual competition, three fencers of each qualified team are qualified.</span>
		Then all already qualified nations are removed from the rankings and only the best fencer from each nation is kept.
		<span class="qualified_2">The two best Europeans, the two best Asians, the best American and the best African fencer are then qualified.</span>
		<span class="qualified_4">Finally, all countries with no qualified athlete can send one athlete to the zonal qualifiers.</span>
		At each of the zonal qualifiers, only the winner will qualify for the Olympic Games. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="index_paragraph">
		After mastering the understanding of this system myself, I spend so much time explaining people these rules that I decided it would be easier to publish the current rankings on a website.
		To do so, a script fetches the current rankings from the FIE webpage, filters the events that took place after 3rd of April 2023 (start of the qualification) and creates a ranking.
		Then, the previously explained rules are applied to determine who would qualify currently.
	</p>
	
	<p class="index_paragraph">
		Of course, there are some caveats I cannot take into account. First, there are 6 additional places for the host nation France (however they cannot start more than three fencers in any given discipline). Second, there is one wildcard per gender. Fourth, if a nation qualifies with a team they can freely choose 4 athletes but here the top 4 athletes are indicated.
